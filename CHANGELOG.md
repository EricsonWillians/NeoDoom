# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [4.15.11] - 2026-08-24

### Fixed

- Fixed a crash (SIGSEGV) when loading a map that has no player start:
  `FLevelLocals::FinishTravel` dereferenced `Players[i]->mo`
  unconditionally, but the actor is never spawned without a player start,
  so the engine died on a null pointer dereference during the initial
  level load. Maps without a player start now load with an empty camera
  instead of taking down the process.

### Documentation

- The README now recommends [Heresy Editor](https://github.com/EricsonWillians/heresy-editor)
  as the companion map editor, with a dedicated "Mapping With Heresy
  Editor" section covering the `biaseddoom` port profile, Test in Game,
  the project workflow, and its modern authoring tools; the documentation
  index links it from the front page and the task table.

## [4.15.10] - 2026-08-14

### Added

- glTF PBR materials now render with the hardware PBR shader (GGX/Cook-Torrance specular) instead of plain diffuse: `metallicRoughnessTexture` is split into its metallic (B) and roughness (G) channels with `metallicFactor`/`roughnessFactor` baked in, normal maps and ambient occlusion maps (with `occlusionStrength` baked) are bound as material layers, and emissive maps render as fullbright brightmaps (suppressed entirely when `emissiveFactor` is zero; the factor's magnitude is not baked in). Materials without any PBR content keep the standard Doom shading, and factor-only materials (no textures at all) get solid-value PBR layers, so e.g. a chrome bumper with `metallicFactor 1` / `roughnessFactor 0` picks up dynamic-light reflections. Two caveats, both shared with TEXTURES-defined PBR materials: there is no environment map, so fully metallic surfaces go dark under ambient-only sector light and need dynamic lights to shine; and `normalScale` is not applied. Set `GLTF_NO_PBR=1` in the environment to force standard shading for comparison or troubleshooting.

### Changed

- **Breaking (visual)**: glTF models now face the actor's angle, matching MD3 behavior — the asset's front (glTF +Z) previously rendered 90° counterclockwise off the thing's facing because the loader passed glTF coordinates through raw. The same raw passthrough also rendered every glTF model **mirrored** (decal text read backwards): the conversion now swaps the X/Z axes, which has the same handedness as the MD3 `(x,z,y)` swap, so chirality matches the asset as authored. The conversion is applied at the scene roots, covering static, baked, skinned and animated models uniformly. glTF things placed in existing maps will appear rotated 90° (and un-mirrored); adjust their angles (or add `AngleOffset -90` to their MODELDEF) to restore the old look. Model-facing vertical/horizontal placement can be fine-tuned with the existing MODELDEF `Offset x y z` (Doom axes and units, applied around the thing's position and angle) — e.g. `Offset 0 0 24` lifts a model whose origin sits below its base so it rests on the floor.

### Fixed

- glTF multi-mesh models rendered with scrambled geometry (stretched triangle fans, patchwork panels, out-of-place parts): the vertex buffer stored globally-offset indices while the render state also shifted the vertex attribute pointers by each mesh's vertex offset, so every mesh after the first read vertices belonging to other meshes (or past the buffer). Indices are now mesh-local and the non-indexed path passes a local start, matching the MD3 addressing convention the render state expects.
- glTF nodes authored with a `matrix` property keep their raw matrix instead of being decomposed to TRS and rebuilt (lossy for rotation × non-uniform scale), and the broken translation-only `TRSFromMatrix` stub is gone.
- Fixed a crash at level start (precache) with glTF models having more than 32 meshes: `FGLTFModel::AddSkins` iterated all of the model's meshes over the caller's 32-entry (`MD3_MAX_SURFACES`) surface-skin array, reading out of bounds and writing the precache hitlist at a garbage index. Large scene-scale models (thousands of primitives) now precache correctly.
- glTF loading/rendering quality pass: GLB files with embedded textures (bufferView, in-memory vector, and base64 `data:` URI images) now load their textures instead of falling back to flat colors — images are decoded eagerly into memory-backed textures since the lump-backed image classes cannot re-read embedded data. Normals are now baked with the inverse-transpose of the node matrix, so non-uniform node scale no longer skews shading. The mesh→primitive mapping used by the transform bake is recorded during loading, so a primitive that fails to load no longer misaligns the bake of every mesh after it.
- glTF materials now honor `alphaMode`: `BLEND` meshes (car glass, baked shadow-catcher planes, stickers) render translucent in a second pass after the opaque geometry instead of as solid surfaces, and `MASK` meshes alpha-test at their material `alphaCutoff`. Blended meshes do not write depth, so overlapping translucent surfaces composite instead of clipping each other. `BLEND` meshes are also alpha-tested at their `alphaCutoff` (0.5 when unspecified): without PBR shading, the low-alpha clearcoat/refraction overlay shells common in asset-pack models otherwise fog the whole model — such shells now drop out, while genuinely translucent surfaces can keep their full gradient by setting a low `alphaCutoff` in the asset.
- glTF `baseColorFactor` is now multiplied into the base color texture at render time (via cached tinted texture copies) instead of being ignored whenever a texture was present. Real-world PBR exports are authored this way — e.g. a near-black car paint with factor 0.09 over a gray texture rendered light gray before, and baked shadow planes with a near-zero factor rendered as bright white decals.
- glTF node transforms (TRS or matrix) are now baked into the vertex data of unskinned meshes at load: the renderer uploads raw vertex positions and only applied node transforms through skinning, so real-world assets with transformed nodes (most Sketchfab/Blender exports) rendered at wrong sizes with misplaced parts. Skinned meshes are untouched, and meshes instanced by multiple nodes bake once.
- glTF models now resolve relative texture URIs against the directory of the `.gltf` file itself (per the glTF spec), instead of always assuming a flat `models/` prefix; models in subdirectories like `models/statue/statue.gltf` with a sibling `statue.png` now load their textures (falling back to the old `models/` behavior when the file is not found).
- `A_ChangeModel` no longer rejects an empty modeldef name: the ZScript `''` literal is now treated as "no override", so the actor's own MODELDEF is used — matching what the `GLTFModel` mixin's default `InitGLTFModel(path)` always intended.

### Known issues

- glTF animation playback only applies to skinned meshes (armatures): animation is sampled through skins, so plain node TRS animations on unskinned models currently render in bind pose.
- ZScript mixins do not cross compilation units, so `mixin GLTFModel` only works inside the engine pk3; mod ZScript should call the underlying `Actor` natives (`A_ChangeModel`, `GLTF_PlayAnimation`, `GLTF_UpdateModel`, ...) directly.

## [4.15.9] - 2026-08-09

### Added

- Added a `line_activation_failed` Python event that fires when a line with a nonzero special is activated but the special fails (for example `ACS_Execute` with no backing script), carrying `line_index`, `special`, `args`, `activation_type`, and `actor_ref`. Failed triggers are no longer silent.
- Added a `-scripttest <tics>` command-line mode for CI: the level runs for the given number of tics, then the engine prints `SCRIPT TEST: PASS/FAIL` with the Python error count and exits 0, 1 (errors), or 2 (no level loaded).
- Added a `-pyerrorlog <file>` command-line option appending every reported Python error (including dedup repeat counts) as a JSON line with timestamp, map, context, and traceback, for editors and CI tooling.
- Added a `dumppystub [path]` console command that regenerates the actor-constant block of the `biaseddoom.pyi` type stub from the live class registry (or writes a full skeleton when the file is missing) and warns about any public API missing from the stub.
- Added a static project website under `website/` (standard-library-only generator, restrained retro style): guides, events reference, actor registry, console debugging, VSCode setup, Heresy Editor integration, and the API/roadmap analysis, with the API reference generated from `biaseddoom.pyi` so docs cannot drift. Deploys to GitHub Pages via the `pages.yml` workflow.

- Added a `copyconsole [N]` console command that copies the last `N` console lines, or the entire scrollback when `N` is omitted, to the OS clipboard with color codes stripped, printing a confirmation with the copied line count.
- Added mouse text selection to the console scrollback: drag with the left button to highlight a range (works across wrapped lines), Ctrl+C copies the selection, Ctrl+A selects and copies the entire scrollback with a visible full highlight, and clicking once, pressing Escape, or typing clears the selection. The selection tracks the underlying text while scrolling and is discarded when the console reformats (font or width change, or `clear`).
- Added an actor class registry to the Python API: `bd.actors` now doubles as a discoverable namespace of class constants (`bd.actors.DOOM_IMP` → `"DoomImp"`) covering every non-abstract actor class including mod- and script-defined ones, with `names()`/`constants()`/`dir()` listing, `children_of()` ancestry queries, category helpers (`monsters()`, `projectiles()`, `weapons()`, `items()`, `players()`), `random(kind)` class selection, and `spawn_random(x, y, z, kind=...)` one-call random spawns. `bd.actors(...)` remains callable for live actor queries.
- Added `docs/scripting/biaseddoom.pyi`, a full type stub of the embedded Python module (function signatures, `Actor`/`Line`/`Sector`/`Player` handle members, the `bd.actors` registry, and all built-in actor class constants). Dropping it into a `typings/` folder at the VSCode workspace root enables completions and inline docs via Pylance's default stub path.

### Changed

- In the console, Ctrl+A now selects and copies the entire scrollback (visibly highlighted) instead of moving the cursor to the start of the input line. Ctrl+C copies the highlighted selection when one exists, then the input line when it doesn't.

### Fixed

- Repeated identical Python errors are now deduplicated: a traceback that repeats every tick is printed once and summarized ("repeated N times") instead of flooding the console and logfile. Buffered Python `print()` output is flushed before each traceback so messages and errors appear in the order they happened.

## [4.15.8] - 2026-08-03

### Added

- Added engine-wide support for huge maps with coordinates and sector heights through ±262144 (`MAX_MAP_COORD`), replacing the old ±32768 ceiling of 16.16 fixed point: double-precision node building and traversal, double-precision `node_t` partition lines and bounding boxes, double-precision subsector and blockmap lookups, and UDMF coordinate validation against the new range. UDMF `heightfloor`/`heightceiling` values are accepted through the full range, so floors and ceilings can sit far beyond the classic ±32767 limit; legacy node formats that cannot represent oversized maps are rejected and rebuilt automatically.
- Added `HW_SKY_EXTENT` sky geometry scaled to the full coordinate range: sky walls, portal stencil caps, and horizon portal grids now cover very tall sectors, and the hardware far plane reaches 262144 units.
- Added automatic visibility scaling on very large maps: fog density, global visibility, thick-fog distance, and the sky fog veil scale with the map's bounding-box diagonal instead of crushing distant geometry to black with constants tuned for ~2000-unit maps. Classic-size maps are unaffected.
- Added a physically-based fog shading rewrite: exponential optical-depth transmittance, optional spatial turbulence with bounded floating-point error at extreme coordinates, banding dither, and a smooth minimum-visibility floor without contour discontinuities. The sky dome renders its own atmospheric horizon layer with per-vertex alpha and a true pole so translucent passes never double-blend.
- The sky dome zenith now renders a per-wedge color gradient sampled from the sky texture's own edge bands, replacing the flat average-color cap that produced a featureless disc over tall sky sectors.

### Changed

- Procedural map generation allows sizes up to 160 (from 80) with a widened coordinate safety band, taking advantage of the extended coordinate range.
- The sky is no longer darkened by stale sector light levels in any light mode; sky at infinity always renders at full brightness.
- Fog menu options clarify turbulence-free and exponential-height-falloff modes.

### Fixed

- Fixed uninitialized lightmap coordinates on sky dome vertices, which could sample garbage light data.
- Fixed red/blue channel inversion on the sky zenith cap gradient.
- Fixed a software-renderer visplane hash that overflowed fixed point on plane heights beyond ±32767.

## [4.15.7] - 2026-07-20

### Added

- Added an opt-in embedded CPython API v2 alongside ACS and ZScript, with trusted same-container manifests, synchronous filtered lifecycle/gameplay callbacks, scheduling, live actor/player/sector/line handles, native mutation and attack helpers, ACS execution, typed public ZScript calls, savegame state, whole-tic budgets, multiplayer/demo guards, twelve focused examples, and integration tooling.
- Added deterministic cross-platform IWAD discovery with `-findiwads`, `DOOMWADPATH`, explicit recursive paths, content validation, normalized de-duplication, short-name launch selection, modern/legacy Steam library and app-manifest parsing, external/renamed library support, Flatpak/Snap/macOS/Windows roots, and Linux `~/.steam/debian-installation` coverage.
- Added `biaseddoom-audio-probe`, automatic audio diagnostic logs, `snd_status` decoder reporting, detailed endpoint listings, and root-level troubleshooting documentation.

### Changed

- Official Windows builds now statically bundle pinned OpenAL Soft and libsndfile with OGG, FLAC, Opus, and MPEG support. CI, native Windows, MinGW, and release packaging validate the static dependency closure and reject loose audio/codec DLL regressions.
- Windows and MinGW helpers now package required runtimes, detect stale incompatible MinGW thread-model archives, and run the Windows audio/codec regression probe under Wine when available.
- Native release packages include the embedded Python standard library and license when supported; MinGW explicitly retains Python stubs while preserving ACS and ZScript.
- Python examples use a portable `pyscripts/` resource directory, and their packager derives content roots from each manifest instead of requiring a case-conflicting folder name.

### Fixed

- OpenAL initialization now falls back to silent output with bounded automatic retries when no endpoint is temporarily available. Active disconnects reopen the configured or default device in place so buffers, sources, effects, and music streams survive monitor, GPU, USB, and default-device changes.
- Audio failures now record exact ALC errors, driver overrides, backend/device/extension/source details, and decoder availability in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\biaseddoom\biaseddoom-audio.log` (or a packaged-directory fallback). `-audiodiagnostics` saves the report even when initialization succeeds.
- Mod-provided sounds that fail decoding now name both the logical sound and WAD/PK3 resource path, and an empty-decode path no longer leaks its decoder.
- Steam discovery now follows actual library/app-manifest metadata instead of relying on fragile hard-coded install folders, while rejecting unsafe `installdir` traversal and duplicate candidates.
- Native Windows and macOS vcpkg resolution now pins the helper ports required by CPython 3.12.13 while preserving the established dependency baseline. Bundled-codec discovery prefers vcpkg config packages, avoiding case-insensitive `mpg123` module collisions, and MinGW packaging uses a GCC 13 runner with the C++20 library required by OpenAL Soft 1.25.1. Example resources no longer collide as `PYTHON` and `python` on case-insensitive filesystems.

## [4.15.6] - 2026-07-18

### Added

- Procedural maps now reserve deterministic, theme-aware shallow water, blood, nukage, and lava architecture spanning central, trench, paired, and irregular pools; whole flooded rooms with dry islands; and straight, staggered, or bending multi-cell watercourses. Natural banks, 80-unit dry circulation bands, and 64-unit causeways make liquids part of traversal and combat composition rather than pairs of decorative pits, while nukage and lava retain their classic UDMF damage behavior.
- Procedural levels now select a seed-stable soundtrack from a random map that actually exists in the active IWAD, including the correct reduced roster for Doom shareware and the full Ultimate Doom/Doom II rosters.
- Fixed-seed feature and compatibility matrices now prove every pool/river, reveal-family, reveal-cue, and elevated-position family across themes, including harmless/hazardous liquid mixes and Doom/Ultimate Doom texture availability.

### Changed

- Key traps and switch-opened opportunity spaces now vary among freestanding pavilions, framed wall alcoves, and chambers behind perimeter false walls, with prominent, subtle, and room-matched hidden opening cues selected deterministically from feasible geometry.
- Elevated ranged-monster positions now vary among square stair platforms, chamfered turrets, and wall-backed balconies with straight, offset, or dogleg 16-unit stair approaches.
- Procedural room composition now uses explicit connector, small, medium, and major spatial classes plus compact, axial, and compound footprint families. Seed-stable uneven grid cadence, L/T/cross/stepped growth, nonuniform wall slopes, broad same-room openings, longer foldback loops, and raised cross-room sightlines replace the previous field of similarly sized near-square modules.
- The secret budget now scales more aggressively with size and detail, and every switch-opened opportunity cache is an engine-counted secret while key-triggered ambush chambers remain ordinary encounters.

### Fixed

- Successful ACS termination notices now use the existing developer-level script trace channel instead of normal console notifications. Mods that synchronously query short ACS functions such as `GetCrosshair` no longer flood ordinary gameplay output, while developer-level tracing and all script warnings and errors remain available.
- Fixed repeated `AL_INVALID_ENUM` console errors on OpenAL implementations without `AL_EXT_source_distance_model`. Per-source Doppler is now applied only when the extension exists, which also restores FluidSynth, TiMidity++, OPL, GUS, WildMIDI, ADL, and OPN streaming on affected systems instead of leaving the external Microsoft GS Wavetable synth as the only working MIDI output.
- Procedural soundtrack selection now reapplies the chosen IWAD music after `PROCMAP` generation, fixing the previous lifecycle ordering where the selection was logged after initial music setup but no track became active.
- Fluid planning now uses safe spare cells in composed landmark rooms instead of collapsing ordinary-size maps to small local pools; progression cells remain excluded, and natural banks retain their validated dry clearance around nearby walls and features.
- Framed opportunity-alcove piers are inset from chamfered shells, preventing a rare intersecting loop that made the node builder synthesize a dummy subsector.
- The full cross-platform CI matrix now installs its explicitly selected legacy compiler, bootstraps the repository-pinned vcpkg toolchain, and exercises glTF support, preventing native configurations from failing when `g++-9` or `fastgltf` is absent on a clean runner. The restored submodule metadata also removes checkout warnings, and release-tag pushes no longer duplicate the branch CI matrix.

## [4.15.5] - 2026-07-15

### Added

- Procedural savegames now archive the exact generated UDMF together with seed, theme, difficulty, size, layout, verticality, detail, and outdoor metadata, preserving the original base map across generator revisions.
- Added deterministic Layout Shape, Verticality, Architecture Detail, and Outdoor Spaces menu controls, each backed by an independent generation-effect and runtime/node regression.
- All five procedural themes now own architectural silhouettes, ceiling/elevation behavior, courtyard and interactive-feature cadence, colored lighting, landmark materials, trim, and prop rhythms; Corrupted Tech gains dedicated four-phase hybrid surfaces.
- Procedural routes now use broad multi-level terraces connected by full-width 8-unit stair sectors; structural regression checks require a 96-unit vertical range and size-scaled stair coverage.
- Procedural progression now audits every composed connection by lock stage and rejects any cross-stage opening that is not the single planned keyed gate.
- Structural validation removes keyed door sectors and proves that ordinary doors and open portals cannot reconnect either side of a key gate.
- Added Industrial, Gothic, and Corrupted Tech procedural themes with distinct material transitions and decoration vocabularies.
- Added size-scaled deep-branch survival caches, a guaranteed main-route recovery cadence, and substantially denser role-aware decoration.
- Added size-80 extreme-map generation with guarded UDMF coordinate limits and regression coverage for real runtime loading.
- Added a fixed-seed, all-theme size-80 regression for seed `1771465796`, including serialized passage-clearance and real node-builder checks.
- Added a five-seed maximum-size stress matrix with developer-level BSP diagnostics; renderer-dangerous coincident lines, open/branched sector boundaries, zero-area loops, and synthetic hole subsectors are now regression failures.
- Procedural secrets now use the engine's real `SECRET_MASK`, receive staged backpack, invisibility, berserk, soulsphere, computer-map, light-amplification, invulnerability, and Doom II megasphere rewards, and have dedicated structural/runtime regressions.
- Ordinary doors now select stock 64×72, 128×96, 128×112, and 64/128×128 profiles by theme and IWAD, including Doom II `SPCDOOR` variants.

### Changed

- Screenshot requests are captured after final 2D composition and before presentation, so full-screen automap, HUD, and console layers are included consistently by OpenGL, GLES, and Vulkan.
- Ordinary procedural room floors now follow a `0 → 32 → 64 → 96` terrace rhythm with deterministic branch offsets and a bounded 64-unit inter-room transition, replacing shallow per-room height jitter.
- Key-triggered ambushes and switch-opened opportunity caches now vary silhouette, floor/ceiling treatment, lighting, reveal-door prominence, and actor/reward layout; some cache switches are placed in a nearby room within the same lock stage.
- Procedural surface families now use broader IWAD-safe palettes and progression/role clusters. Continuous chamber walls retain one material, while connector, jamb, platform, and reveal accents change only at visible geometry seams.
- The procedural size slider now reaches 80, optional-branch density is higher, major fights receive more recovery, and ordinary rooms attempt one to three decorations instead of being mostly bare.
- Sizes above 40 now reflow excess horizontal growth into height and center the emitted bounds, retaining extreme capacity without placing starts against the UDMF coordinate edge.
- Industrial and Gothic now use dedicated four-phase wall, floor, and ceiling tables; every theme has a more varied semantic prop rhythm.
- Same-room joins now use explicit 224–256-unit hall portals instead of consuming whole coarse-cell edges, keeping huge four-way junctions topologically well-defined.
- Direct recovery now has a deterministic floor of one substantial pickup per four authored monsters, so high-difficulty huge maps scale their survival economy with actual encounter pressure.
- Door openings now inherit the selected stock texture's native width and height, with explicit lowered approach sectors forming real lintels on both sides instead of fitting one motif to every tall room.
- The macOS deployment target and application metadata now require macOS 10.15, matching the C++17 filesystem support required by the enabled glTF stack.

### Fixed

- Hardware sky fog now uses a non-overlapping, continuously interpolated 32-strip hemisphere, eliminating concentric rings and translucent fan wedges when looking into the sky.
- GLES mapped-buffer subupdates no longer write through a missing CPU shadow allocation, preventing a crash when the new sky-fog gradient is uploaded through the compatibility renderer.
- Saving an in-memory procedural map no longer dereferences the invalid `-1` map-lump container and crashes. Loading stages the archived TEXTMAP before world restoration instead of depending on ambient procedural CVars.
- Automap screenshots no longer capture the hidden 3D view underneath the map overlay.
- Door thresholds that must remain level are normalized before emission; every other non-level room connection receives a traversable staircase instead of an impassable ledge.
- Room composition and UDMF emission can no longer turn a progression-stage boundary into a normal unlocked door or opening.
- Corridor support textures no longer begin in the middle of a flat chamber wall; 8-unit depth returns provide a natural architectural transition.
- Remote opportunity switches are assigned only to rooms proven to contain a full panel wall, preventing large-map generation failures in highly connected one-cell rooms.
- Solid decorations now reserve 112-unit approaches around passages, doors, lifts, and full stair routes, plus a tighter exclusion around shallow landmark tiers, instead of checking actor overlap alone.
- Maximum-width four-way joins no longer emit coincident solid lines or zero-area pinwheel boundaries that produced black floor/ceiling holes after GL-node construction.
- Exit and key chambers with sufficient physical space now always receive their authored landmark platform, including single-cell exits on huge seeds.
- Dramatic terraces on maximum Exploratory graphs now use a graph-distance fallback when cyclic local relaxation cannot converge, guaranteeing every adjacent rise remains within the eight-tread staircase bound.
- Every mission graph now reserves a one-door optional leaf before landmark expansion; loops and room merging cannot consume it, so compact seeds still contain a genuine hidden reward rather than a through-route secret flag.
- Compact maps may place perches and safely bypassable lifts on terrace cells when no level feature cell remains; each feature replaces the cell with its own validated platform or stair geometry instead of aborting generation.
- Mandatory theme landmarks use a collision- and passage-checked wall-bay fallback, keeping Hell finale markers and dense Gothic dressing present without blocking doors, stairs, or gameplay actors.
- Door art no longer extends into adjoining wall shoulders: each moving face matches its native 64- or 128-unit texture width, and every 16-unit slab retains a nonzero recessed approach on both sides.
- Secret supplies avoid landmark and combat-feature footprints, and the expanded reward-slot layout prevents multiple survival pickups from occupying the same coordinate.
- Linux-hosted Windows packaging now prefers the POSIX MinGW-w64 thread model, preventing glTF's simdjson dependency from being compiled without `std::thread`, `std::mutex`, and `std::condition_variable` support.
- Tagged release packaging no longer treats an absent optional runtime file or resource directory as a fatal native Windows or macOS packaging error.
- Release checksums are now generated portably on Linux, Windows, and macOS and record relocatable artifact basenames instead of runner-local absolute paths.
- MinGW cross-builds now target the Vista-or-newer Windows SDK surface across every bundled C and C++ library, exposing the synchronization and common-file-dialog interfaces used by ZMusic and ZWidget on older MinGW-w64 toolchains.
- Native Windows release staging now uses Git Bash's POSIX workspace path for resource discovery and workspace-relative action outputs for artifact upload, reliably including the generated PK3 resources without confusing Windows path translation.

## [4.15.4] - 2026-07-13

### Added

- Procedural map sizes now use a 1–20 slider, extending deterministic generation from compact missions through colossal maps.
- Procedural landmarks can include switch-operated supply reveals, key-triggered ambush closets, raised ranged perches, broad stair tiers, and optional reward lifts with permanent bypasses.
- Player-facing mugshot controls now provide 0.25x–4x scaling, horizontal/vertical positioning, and one-action reset for stock ZScript and legacy SBARINFO status bars.
- Autoaim now has explicit off support and independently tunable horizontal and vertical assistance.

### Changed

- Procedural ordinary rooms begin at broader multi-cell targets, while hubs, arenas, key rooms, and finales grow with map size and combat difficulty.
- Procedural encounters use safer room-aware pressure, stronger major-fight support, and larger finale floor areas at every higher difficulty step.
- Player skin selection now survives gameplay-mod player replacements and remains visible on the actual actor in first-person state changes and third-person views.
- Procedural texture phases are centered per segment so opposite walls, doorway shoulders, chamfers, and accent surfaces align symmetrically.
- Exit landmarks, keyed-door borders, outdoor spaces, and room silhouettes now have clearer visual language and greater variation.

### Fixed

- Raised procedural areas now include traversable stairs or lift/bypass routes instead of leaving required spaces unreachable.
- Cyberdemons require a finale of at least eight merged cells, and Spider Masterminds are no longer selected for generated finales.
- High-resolution mugshots no longer need global texture edits to fit classic status-bar slots.
- Tight procedural rooms no longer receive heavyweight bosses or disproportionate encounter caps.

## [4.15.3] - 2026-07-10

### Added

- Six fog presets with quality, height-falloff, turbulence, and sky-horizon controls.
- Adaptive third-person shot-impact crosshairs with depth cueing, target colors, and viewport clamping.
- A persistent Procedural Game setup and launch menu with deterministic seeds, theme, difficulty, and size controls.
- Mission-graph-first procedural levels with staged keys, lock-safe loops, hubs, arenas, outdoor landmarks, secrets, and guaranteed weapon progression.
- A detailed procedural-generation implementation and evaluation paper under `docs/engine/`.
- **Release Packaging**: Added a tagged GitHub release pipeline that publishes a Linux AppImage, Windows x64 packages, macOS packaging, and SHA256 checksums.
- **Windows Build Helper**: Added `tools/build-windows.ps1` to bootstrap vcpkg, build with Visual Studio 2022, and create a shareable Windows zip.
- **Windows MinGW Cross Build**: Added `tools/build-windows-mingw.sh`, a MinGW-w64 toolchain, CI coverage, and release packaging for a Linux-built Windows x64 `.exe` zip.
- **glTF Support**: Integrated glTF 2.0 model loading through `fastgltf`, including `.gltf`/`.glb`, initial skeletal animation, and material rendering fixes.

### Changed

- Main list menus now scroll with wheel, arrows, Page Up/Down, Home, and End, keeping oversized mod menus fully accessible.
- Procedural rooms now vary their cell composition, footprint, chamfers, floor elevation, clear height, surfaces, accents, lighting, landmarks, and decoration.
- Procedural encounters use gentler per-room caps, later heavy-monster tiers, stronger major-fight ammunition, and more consistent recovery support.
- Procedural menu entries are restored after gameplay mods replace the engine main menu.
- **Project Rename**: Renamed NeoDoom to BiasedDoom, including the `biaseddoom` executable, CMake variables, build scripts, and documentation.
- **SBARINFO Support**: Added custom mugshot scaling and positioning support.

### Fixed

- Tall procedural door textures no longer tile vertically; narrow door motifs are centered instead of asymmetrically cropped.
- Closed map geometry, wall winding, texture alignment, functional keyed doors, IWAD-specific actor compatibility, and deterministic map loading now have expanded regression coverage.
