# Persistent display list: scripts register an item once and the engine

# update/animate). Screen-space coordinates and sizes are normalized
# fractions (0..1) of the screen; world-anchored items are projected to
# screen space every frame.
#
# Every draw_* function accepts two extra keyword-only arguments:
#   layer=0      z-order; higher layers render on top, and within a layer
#                items render in registration order.

    not given, the fill color is an automatic per-frame gradient: green
    above 60% health, yellow 30-60%, red at or below 30%; passing an
    explicit fg (r, g, b) tuple overrides the gradient with a static color
    (fallback without gradient: (220, 40, 40)). bg is the inset background
    color, (20, 20, 20) by default. The bar is drawn with an opaque black
    2px border over a padded, ~85% opacity background automatically.
    occlude=True hides the bar when the player has no line of sight to the
    actor (caveat: the sight test runs from the player actor even in chase
    cam). label=True draws the actor's GetTag() name centered above the bar
    using label_font/label_scale; label_color accepts an (r, g, b) tuple or
    a font color name string. The bar fades out over the last 20% of
    max_distance and is hidden entirely beyond it or behind the camera,
    draws nothing while the actor is dead, and vanishes automatically when
    the actor is destroyed or the map unloads. width/height are normalized
    screen fractions. id is required; reusing it replaces the item.
