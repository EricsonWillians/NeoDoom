# Embedded Python Example Suite

These are small, independently packageable mods for BiasedDoom Python API v2.
They complement the exhaustive `hello_world` integration fixture by teaching
one idea at a time.

> Python mods are trusted native-equivalent code. Review them and launch with
> `-python`; merely loading a PK3 does not opt in.

## Try them interactively

```sh
tools/play-python-example.py
```

An arrow-key menu that auto-detects your engine build and `doom2.wad`, then
launches the selected example on MAP01 -- no packaging or flags to remember.
Press `t` instead of ENTER for a headless self-check (`-scripttest`, wrapped
in `xvfb-run` when no display is available). `BIASEDDOOM_EXE` and
`BIASEDDOOM_IWAD` override detection.

## Build and run

Build every example:

```bash
./tools/build-python-examples.sh
```

Or select examples:

```bash
./tools/build-python-examples.sh 02_live_actor_handles 10_zscript_bridge
```

Then run one against a Doom II-compatible IWAD:

```bash
./build/biaseddoom -iwad /path/to/DOOM2.WAD \
    -file ./build/python-examples/02_live_actor_handles.pk3 \
    -python -stdout
```

Several interactive examples use the engine's `User1` through `User4` action
buttons. Bind those actions in Customize Controls before trying the indicated
keys. Examples that name `ZombieMan`, `Rocket`, `Clip`, or Doom sound/music
lumps are intentionally Doom II-oriented; the lifecycle, state, task, VFS,
and handle patterns themselves are game-independent.

Validate source and package structure with:

```bash
./tools/test-python-examples.sh
```

Pass `--iwad PATH` to additionally start MAP01 with every PK3 in a real engine
process, run its initial map/tick callbacks, and verify a clean Python-driven
exit.

See the [complete API guide](../../docs/scripting/python.md) for exact contracts,
security, performance budgets, packaging, and savegame behavior.
