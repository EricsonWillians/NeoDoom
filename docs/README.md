# BiasedDoom Documentation

Use this page as the front door for project docs. The folder is organized by
audience:

- [glTF modding](gltf/README.md) - Blender assets, player replacement, ZScript, and glTF tools.
- [Development notes](development/README.md) - implementation details, diagnostics, and historical status notes.
- [Engine features](engine/README.md) - non-glTF gameplay/engine feature guides.
- [Scripting](scripting/README.md) - embedded Python plus ACS/ZScript interoperability.
- [Audio troubleshooting](audio-troubleshooting.md) - Windows/OpenAL diagnostics, logs, device recovery, and custom OGG checks.
- [Release process](release/README.md) - maintainer release checklist.
- [Root troubleshooting](../TROUBLESHOOTING.md) - startup, IWAD, audio, mods, Python, builds, and reporting.

Root-level markdown is reserved for repository-wide entry points and metadata
such as `README.md`, `TROUBLESHOOTING.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `SECURITY.md`, and
`AGENTS.md`. Source-local notes and packaged license files stay beside the code
or assets they describe.

## Recommended glTF Path

1. [glTF quick start](gltf/quick-start.md)
2. [Blender authoring](gltf/blender-authoring.md)
3. [Player replacement workflow](gltf/player-replacement-workflow.md)
4. [ZScript usage](gltf/zscript-usage.md)
5. [ZScript API](gltf/zscript-api.md)

For textured glTF assets, use `.gltf + .bin + external textures`. `.glb` is
supported for geometry and animation loading, but embedded image texture decoding
is still limited, so external textures are the safest modding workflow.
